            <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> People Looking For a New Career</h3>
            <p>Web Developers are well paid. According to Indeed, Web Developers make, on 
            average, $60,000 a year in Utah. Most of our students leaving the program 
            make about $16-$24 an hour, or between $33,000 to $49,000 a year upon 
            graduation. Pay usually increases after about 1 year of experience.</p>
            
            <h3><i class="fas fa-feather-alt"></i> Entrepreneurs or Freelancers</h3>
            <p>Whether you want to make a website for your company or you want to 
            Freelance and make websites for others the Web &amp; Mobile Development 
            program can hlep you make your dream a reality. Many business owners don't 
            have the budget to pay a Web Developer, the program will teach you how. As 
            a Freelancer your income is only limited by how much you are willing to 
            put into your business. Furthermore; there is nothing quite as rewarding 
            as working on something you have built.</p>

                        <p>Web sites not only need to look great, but they also need to function 
                        properly and be easy and intuitive to use. Nothing is more frustrating to 
                        a user then not being able to figure out how to interact with an 
                        application. In the UI/UX track you will learn how to make websites that 
                        look great and are easy to use and help attract customers.</p>
